Analyze the following user feedback about the product. For each feedback, provide a structured analysis in JSON format.

Examples of correct analysis:

Feedback: "I've been using this for about a month now and I'm really impressed with the battery life. It lasts way longer than my previous device. The only downside is that it's a bit heavy to carry around all day."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Battery life and portability",
  "positives": ["Impressive battery life", "Long-lasting performance"],
  "painPoints": ["Heavy weight", "Portability issues"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["Reduce device weight", "Improve ergonomics"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["Battery", "Portability"],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Feedback: "The screen is amazing! Colors are vibrant and the refresh rate is smooth. However, I wish the speakers were louder and the price is a bit steep for what you get."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Display quality and audio",
  "positives": ["Vibrant colors", "Smooth refresh rate", "High-quality screen"],
  "painPoints": ["Low speaker volume", "High price point"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["Increase speaker volume", "Adjust pricing strategy"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["Display", "Speakers", "Price"],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}

Feedback: "Just got this yesterday and I'm still figuring out how to use it. The manual is not very helpful."

Analysis:
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "User experience and documentation",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": ["Unclear instructions", "Poor documentation", "Steep learning curve"],
  "improvementSuggestions": ["Improve user manual", "Add more tutorials", "Simplify interface"],
  "featuresMentioned": ["Documentation", "User interface"],
  "userExpertise": "Novice"
}

Now analyze the following feedback using the same format and structure. For each feedback:
1. Determine the overall sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed)
2. Assess the relevance of the feedback (isRelevant)
3. Identify the main subject of discussion
4. List positive aspects
5. Note pain points
6. Suggest possible improvements
7. Mark mentioned features
8. Evaluate user expertise level

Feedback to analyze:

1. "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, $150 mouse btw"

2. "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

Provide the analysis in JSON format for each feedback.
