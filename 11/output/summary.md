## Резюме

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, occurring intermittently for three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10, sometimes radiating to the neck, without associated symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other systemic signs. He recently recovered from the flu and has no significant past medical history, medications, allergies, or surgeries. Notably, his father died of a heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient significant anxiety about his symptoms. He denies smoking, recreational drug use, and drinks alcohol occasionally. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the cause of the chest pain, reassuring the patient while emphasizing the need for further investigation.
