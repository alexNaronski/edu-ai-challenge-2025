## Резюме

The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, occurring intermittently for three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. There are no associated symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other systemic signs. The patient recently recovered from the flu. There is a significant family history, as the patient's father died from a heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient to worry about having a heart attack. The patient does not smoke, use recreational drugs, or have significant medical history. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the heart and reassure the patient while addressing their concerns.
