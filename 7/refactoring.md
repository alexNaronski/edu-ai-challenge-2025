# Sea Battle Game Refactoring

## Overview
The original Sea Battle game was refactored to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability while preserving the core game mechanics. The refactoring focused on modernizing the codebase and implementing best practices in software development.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Code Modernization
- Converted to ES6+ syntax
- Replaced `var` with `const` and `let`
- Implemented classes and modules
- Used arrow functions
- Added JSDoc documentation
- Implemented async/await for better flow control

### 2. Architecture Improvements
- Implemented proper separation of concerns:
  - `Game`: Core game logic and flow control
  - `Player`: Player and CPU management
  - `Board`: Game board state and operations
  - `Ship`: Ship state and operations
  - `GameUI`: User interface and input/output handling
- Eliminated global variables
- Improved encapsulation of game state
- Added configuration options

### 3. Code Organization
- Created a modular structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── models/
  │   ├── Board.js
  │   ├── Player.js
  │   └── Ship.js
  ├── ui/
  │   └── GameUI.js
  ├── tests/
  │   ├── Board.test.js
  │   ├── Player.test.js
  │   └── Ship.test.js
  ├── Game.js
  └── index.js
  ```

### 4. Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests using Jest
- Implemented test coverage for core game mechanics
- Added test cases for:
  - Ship placement and hit detection
  - Board state management
  - Player and CPU behavior
  - Game flow control

### 5. Maintainability Improvements
- Added clear and consistent naming conventions
- Implemented proper error handling
- Added input validation
- Improved code readability with proper formatting and comments
- Added configuration options for game parameters

## Preserved Features
- 10x10 game grid
- Random ship placement
- Turn-based gameplay
- CPU opponent with 'hunt' and 'target' modes
- Text-based display
- Core game mechanics and rules

## Testing Coverage
The refactored code includes comprehensive unit tests with coverage exceeding 60% for all core modules. Tests cover:
- Ship creation and hit detection
- Board state management
- Player and CPU behavior
- Game flow control
- Input validation
- Edge cases

## Future Improvements
Potential areas for further improvement:
1. Add a graphical user interface
2. Implement multiplayer support
3. Add difficulty levels for CPU opponent
4. Add game statistics and history
5. Implement save/load game functionality
