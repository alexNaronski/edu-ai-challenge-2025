1. Requirements Analysis:
   - Key Requirements:
     * Social platform with millions of users
     * Storage of profiles, posts, and user connections
     * High data read speed
     * Operation ratio: 80% read, 20% write
     * Importance of scalability
   
   - Priorities:
     * Read performance (critical)
     * Scalability (high priority)
     * Data structure flexibility (medium priority)
   
   - Critical Factors:
     * Large data volume
     * Complex entity relationships
     * Need for fast data access

2. Database Types Evaluation:
   - Relational (SQL) Databases:
     * Advantages:
       - Strong data consistency
       - Support for complex queries and relationships
       - Mature ecosystem
     * Disadvantages:
       - Limitations in horizontal scaling
       - May be slower with large data volumes

   - NoSQL Databases:
     * Advantages:
       - Excellent horizontal scalability
       - High performance with large volumes
       - Flexible data schema
     * Disadvantages:
       - Limited support for complex queries
       - Less strict data consistency

3. Performance Analysis:
   - Read/Write Operations:
     * 80% read operations require optimization for fast access
     * 20% write operations allow for caching
   
   - Scalability:
     * Need for horizontal scaling
     * Load distribution across nodes
   
   - Data Storage:
     * Structured data (profiles)
     * Semi-structured data (posts)
     * Complex relationships (social graph)

4. Comparative Analysis:
   - Relational DBs:
     * Well-suited for structured data
     * Scaling challenges
     * May be slower with large volumes
   
   - NoSQL DBs:
     * Excellent scaling capabilities
     * Fast performance
     * Less strict consistency

5. Conclusion:
   - Optimal Solution: Hybrid Approach
     * Primary Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
       - Excellent read performance
       - Horizontal scalability
       - Flexible data schema
     * Additional: Redis for caching
       - Accelerate frequent read operations
       - Reduce load on primary DB
   
   - Justification:
     * MongoDB provides required performance and scalability
     * Redis complements the solution for read optimization
     * Hybrid approach leverages benefits of both DB types
   
   - Alternative Options:
     * PostgreSQL with sharding
     * Cassandra for distributed storage
     * Neo4j for graph data (user connections)
